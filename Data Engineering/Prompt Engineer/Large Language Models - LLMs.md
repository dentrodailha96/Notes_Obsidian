+ Deep learning algorithm that can perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 

### Parameters
+ TOP K: 
Greedy Sampling, leads to coherent but uncreative outputs like always ordering the single most popular/likely menu item.
Top-k limits the model’s output to the top-k most probable tokens at each step. This can help reduce incoherent or nonsensical output by restricting the model’s vocabulary. (https://rumn.medium.com/setting-top-k-top-p-and-temperature-in-llms-3da3a8f74832)
