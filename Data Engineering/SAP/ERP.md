+ Granularity simply refers to defining services so that they relate to the
individual steps of a business process. If you define these steps in just
the right granular way, they can be more easily and flexibly rearranged
and modified. Think of granularity as a fashion statement: If you put on a
jumpsuit with pants and a shirt all in one piece, you can’t change the top
when you want to dress things up. If you wear a separate top and pants,
you’ve got more granularity, and more fashion flexibility.
+ Pull versus push: ERP System is proactively pushing information to you so that you don't have to.
+ Role-based paradigm: IT administrator defines sets of policies that belong to you based on your role in your company.
