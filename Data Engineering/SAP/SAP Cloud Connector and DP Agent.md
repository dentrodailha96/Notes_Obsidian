### ODPs 
» What are ODPs? Specialized tools designed to extract specific datasets from SAP S/HANA.

» ODP Technical Infrastructure:

- **Operational Data Provisioning (ODP) Framework:** This is the modern framework for CDC, replacing the older RSA7 (BW Delta Queues) approach. It simplifies data extraction and management.
- **Operational Delta Queue (ODQ):** This queue stores changes made to data until they are replicated.
### Extractors 
+ Bridges between SAP and outside world. 

#### Data Builder Objects in SAP Datasphere facilitate your integration with SAP S/4HANA:

1. **Remote Tables:** Enable access to SAP S/4HANA data in real-time or through snapshots.
2. **Replication Flows:** These define the path for data replication from source to target system.
3. **Data Flows:** These specify the transformations applied to the data during replication.
