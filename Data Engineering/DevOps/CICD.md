* Continuous Integration and continuous delivery.
* CI/CD is crucial because it automates the software development process, from coding through deployment.

### CI 
Practice of integrating all your code changes into the main branch of a share source code repository early and often. Automatically testing each change when you commit or merge them and automatically kicking off a build. 

### CD
Software development practice that works in conjunction with CI to automate the infrastructure provisioning and application release process. 

### Pipeline
Automated process utilized by software development teams to streamline the creating, testing and development of applications. 

### Fundamentals
1. A single source repository.
2. Frequent check-ins to main branch.
3. Automated builds.
4. Self-testing builds.
5. Frequent iterations.
6. Stable testing environments. 
7. Maximum visibility 
8. Predictable deployments anytime.
