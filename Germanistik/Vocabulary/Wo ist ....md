These prepositions can take either the dative or the accusative case, hence the name "two-case preposition." When we use "wo", we're asking about a place, not a direction. This two-case preposition is then followed by the dative.  
The dative form of the article for masculine and neuter nouns is "dem" or "einem". The dative form for feminine nouns is "der" or "einer". The dative form of the definite article for plural nouns is "den".
